# Poly Skeleton Mesh
`Poly Skeleton Mesh` is a tool that automatically creates low-poly meshes through node skeletons. Using this tool, creators only need to adjust a few simple parameters such as the position of each node in the skeleton and section radius, and the tool will automatically create a low-poly mesh based on the relationships between nodes. Then, by splicing multiple skeleton meshes, a more complex mesh model can be created. The generated mesh models can be exported as prefabs with automatically bound `SkinnedMeshRenderer` components.
